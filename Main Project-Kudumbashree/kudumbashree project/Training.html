<h5><font color=red>TRAINING PROGRAMS</font></h5>

<h6>Capacity building is an ongoing process where the Mission capacitates all its stakeholders for its sustainability in the long run. The Mission fulfills this objective by providing necessary handholding support in the form of trainings and providing required resources to its various stake holders. As the Mission’s activities are varied, the type of trainings offered and services its renders too varies. The three tier organizational system of the Kudumbashree network,the three tier LSGs and the Community Institution Management system involved in various trainings of Kudumbashree network and the Kudumbashree entrepreneurs are capacitated at different levels as per the requirements. In short, the capacity building programmes of Kudumbashree comprises of four elements viz, Organizational Development, Strengthening of Community Based Organizations, Strengthening of Community Supporting Groups and Livelihood Management.

Kudumbashree over the years recognized that the ownership of the community in all the Kudumbashree programmes only would yield result and therefore development of community institution managements in the form of training groups for different purposes in addition to the recognized government and non government organizations has become alive. These Community Training Groups of the Mission takes the form of KAASS, the Accounting and Auditing team of the Kudumbashree network, EKSAT for conducting Entrepreneurship development to motivation, MECs, the master trainers for Kudumbashree livelihood development programmes and specialized training groups like AIFRHM, that would cater the requirements of special livelihood programmes. Main advantage of this kind of training is that mostly trainers are from Kudumbashree’s own group. Kudumbashree members turned trainers are taking class for others. In that way we could reduce the gap between training team and the ultimate beneficiaries and people show more interest to take part in that training.

Kudumbashree is also utilizing the service of other reputed institutions/agencies like IRMA, IIM Kozhikode, IMG, KILA etc for training community as well as Kudumbashree Mission officials. After consulting with the selected institution/agency, the module, training fee and other details will be decided.
